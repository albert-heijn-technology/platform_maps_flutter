# platform_maps_flutter_google_android

This is the Google Maps for Android implementation of the `platform_maps_flutter` plugin.
If you add `platform_maps_flutter` to your pubspec.yaml this will automatically be used.

It's Android only to prevent iOS dependencies for Google Maps being added to your project.
